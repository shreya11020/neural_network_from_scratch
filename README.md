# neural_network_from_scratch
This demonstrates how to implement a simple feed-forward neural network without using deep learning libraries  It includes:  Forward propagation , Activation functions ,Backpropagation for weight updates  ,Training on example datasets  . The goal is to understand the math behind neural networks by coding each step manually.
