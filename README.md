# Neural Network from Scratch 

This project implements a simple **feed-forward neural network** completely from scratch using only **NumPy**.  


---

##  Features
- Forward propagation (matrix multiplications + activation functions)
- Backpropagation (gradient descent weight updates)
- Configurable network architecture
- Simple dataset training & evaluation
- Implemented using only **Python + NumPy** (no TensorFlow, no PyTorch)
